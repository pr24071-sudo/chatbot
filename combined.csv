CareCompass overview for Inpatient Health Care Assistant,"Overview of CareCompass and explain how to use some of its key components:

        CareCompass is an interdisciplinary summary workflow solution that guides you, as a clinician, in planning and prioritising the care of your patients and provides you with the correct information at the right time. CareCompass displays 90% of all the information you need about your patients directly, including important details such as allergies, resuscitation status, reason for visit, and care plans. CareCompass empowers you to make informed decisions faster because you will receive nearly real-time data about each of your assigned patients in a comprehensive view in the context of their plans of care. In addition, you can also directly document patient activities and click links to access other important parts of your patients’ charts (electronic care records).

Choose Royal Blackburn Hospital / Level 3 / ward C18A – Users can also narrow location down to Bay and Beds to create a list of only their patients - Note: Discharge criteria must also be set to “Only Display patients that have not been discharged” this avoids recently discharged patients also displaying on the list.
